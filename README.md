# UITestify – iOS UI Testing Sample App 📱✅

**UITestify** is a lightweight iOS application designed to help developers and QA engineers learn and practice writing UI tests using **XCUITest**. This app mimics a real-world quiz flow with multiple UI components, timers, and result tracking — making it ideal for practicing test case design, accessibility usage, and automation strategies.

## 🚀 Features

- Built with **Swift** and **UIKit**
- Covers key UI test scenarios:
  - Button actions (Start, Reset, Next, Result)
  - Timers for each question
  - Score calculation and result display (Pass/Fail based on 60%)
- Clean architecture for scalable test cases
- Uses **accessibility identifiers** for robust test automation
- Includes conditional button behavior (e.g., Next disabled during quiz)
- Supports edge-case handling and reset flow validation
